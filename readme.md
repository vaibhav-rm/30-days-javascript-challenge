# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge by Chaiaurcode
=====================================================

## About the Challenge
The 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge is a coding challenge designed to help developers improve their JavaScript skills by building a new project every day for 30 days. The challenge is created by Chaiaurcode, a popular YouTube channel and online community for developers.

## My Progress
In this repository, I will be documenting my progress through the 30-day challenge. Each day, I will create a new folder with the corresponding day's project, along with a brief description of what I learned and any challenges I faced.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into folders, each representing a day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

* `index.html`: The HTML file for the project
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the project
* `README.md`: A brief description of the project, including what I learned and any challenges I faced

## Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser. You can also view the code in the `script.js` file to see how the project was implemented.
