# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge by Chaiaurcode
=====================================================

## About the Challenge
The 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge is a coding challenge designed to help developers improve their JavaScript skills by building a new project every day for 30 days. The challenge is created by Chaiaurcode, a popular YouTube channel and online community for developers.

## My Progress
In this repository, I will be documenting my progress through the 30-day challenge. Each day, I will create a new folder with the corresponding day's project, along with a brief description of what I learned and any challenges I faced with my source code.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into directory, each representing a day of the challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find the following:

* `day{num}.js`: The JavaScript file for the problems I solved can be found in corresponding day folder.
* `README.md`: The challenges and tasks given that day, each day has it's own readme for everything related to the problems.

## Getting Started
To get started, simply fork the repository and each day go through the folder of the day and delete my source code `day{num}.js`, That javascript file, Implement the solution to those tasks yourself and push it to your repository. The details of task can be found in `readme.md` of the day directory.
