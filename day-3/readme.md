# Day 3: Control Structures
==========================

## Tasks/Activities

### Activity 1: If-Else Statements

#### Task 1: Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero, and log the result to the console.

#### Task 2: Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote (age >= 18) and log the result to the console.

### Activity 2: Nested If-Else Statements

#### Task 3: Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using nested if-else statements.

### Activity 3: Switch Case

#### Task 4: Write a program that uses a switch case to determine the day of the week based on a number (1-7) and log the day name to the console.

#### Task 5: Write a program that assigns a grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on a score using switch case and log the grade to the console.

### Activity 4: Conditional (Ternary) Operator

#### Task 6: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is even or odd and log the result to the console.

#### Task 7: Write a program to check if a year is a leap year using multiple conditions (divisible by 4 but not 100 unless also divisible by 400) and log the result to the console.

## Feature Requests

## Achievement

By the end of these activities, students will:

* Implement and understand basic control flow with if-else statements.
* Use nested if-else statements to handle multiple conditions.
* Utilize switch cases for controlling flow based on specific values.
* Apply the ternary operator for concise condition checking.
* Combine multiple conditions to solve more complex problems.
